# Summary and Statement of Need

_nasapower_ is an R [@RCT2018] package providing functionality to interface with
the NASA-POWER API [@StackhouseJr2018] for reproducible data retrieval using R.
Two functions, `get_power` and `create_met` are provided. The `get_power`
function provides complete access to all functionality that the POWER API
provides, which includes three user communities, AG (agroclimatoloy), SSE
(Surface meteorology and Solar Energy) and SB (Sustainable Buildings); three
temporal averages, Daily, Inter-annual and Climatology; three geographic
options, single point, regional and global for the appropriate 141 parameters
offered. _nasapower_ uses _lubridate_ [@Grolemund2011] internally to format and
parse dates which are passed along to the the query constructed using _crul_
[@Chamberlain2018] to interface with the POWER API. The query returns a json
response, which is parsed by _jsonlite_ [@Ooms2014] to obtain the url of the
.csv file that has been requested. The .csv file is read directly into R using
_readr_ [@Wickham2017]. Data are returned in a tidy data frame [@Wickham2014] as
a _tibble_ [@Mueller2018]. Two other functions provide functionality to generate
weather input files for agricultural modelling. The `create_met` function is
essentially a wrapper for the `get_power` function coupled with the `prepareMet`
and `writeMet` functions from _APSIM_ [@Fainges2017] to simplify the process of
querying the data and creating .met files for use in Agricultural Production
Systems sIMulator (APSIM) modelling work. While the `create_icasa` function
generates and locally saves a text file in ICASA format for use in the DSSAT
model [@Jones2003; @Hoogenboom2017]. Extended documentation is provided with
examples of converting it to spatial objects using _raster_ [@Hijmans2017].

Integrating this data retrieval and formatting in R will streamline processes
with models such as APSIM [@Keating2003], DSSAT
[@Jones1998; @Jones2003] and EPIRICE [@Savary2012] that can be
linked to or are implemented fully in the R programming language.

# About POWER Data

NASAâ€™s POWER (Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resource) data [@StackhouseJr2018]
are freely available for download via a
[web interface](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/) at a
grid resolution of one-half arc degree longitude by one-half arc degree
latitude. Funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate Applied Science
Program, the data provide daily global coverage from 1983 until near present for
all parameters except precipitation, which is provided for January 1997 to near
present with a several month delay. The data are widely used in agricultural
modelling for modelling crop yields [@Bai2010; @vanWart2013;
@vanWart2015], other crop simulation exercises [@Ojeda2017], plant disease
modelling [@Savary2012].

While _nasapower_ does not redistribute any of the NASA-POWER data, users are
encouraged to please refer to the acknowledgement guidelines available at, <https://power.larc.nasa.gov/common/php/POWER_Acknowledgments.php> and
properly acknowledge the data as requested.

> When POWER data products are used in a publication, we request the following
acknowledgment be included: "_These data were obtained from the NASA Langley
Research Center POWER Project funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate
Applied Science Program._"
