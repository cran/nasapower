Description: Client for 'NASA' 'POWER' global meteorology, surface solar
    energy and climatology data 'API'.  'POWER' (Prediction Of Worldwide Energy 
    Resource) data are freely available for download with varying spatial
    resolutions dependent on the original data and with several temporal
    resolutions depending on the POWER parameter and community.  This work is
    funded through the 'NASA' Earth Science Directorate Applied Science Program.
    For more on the data themselves, the methodologies used in creating, a web-
    based data viewer and web access, please see <https://power.larc.nasa.gov/>.
